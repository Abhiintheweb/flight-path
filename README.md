# Solution:
To address this problem, we employ a depth-first search approach. For instance, consider the journey from Castle Black to Riverrun. Possible paths include:

- Castle Black -> Riverrun
- Castle Black -> Winterfell -> Riverrun
## Calculating Total Price and Path:
Efficiently calculate the total price and path for optimal flight routes within the interconnected cities.
